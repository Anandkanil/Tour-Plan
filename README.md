Features
Card Layout: Each tourist place is displayed as a card, showing:
Name of the place
Short description
Beautiful image representing the place
Interactive Button: Each card contains a "Not Interested" button. When clicked, the corresponding card is removed from the list, allowing users to filter out places they are not interested in.
Dynamic Rendering: React's component-based structure is used to dynamically update the view when a card is removed, without refreshing the entire page.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
